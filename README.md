# Solaria-CMS
CMS-System build on the Solaria Core   
The CMS is build for smal gaming communitys who don't have normaly a programmer.  
The goal of the CMS is it to provide a simple installation and bring some  
features that a gaming community needs like:   
* TS/Discord and Steam intergation  
* Simple and easy rule system  
* Lightweight forum
* Highly customize styles   
and so on...    

# Join the dev team
If you want to help the CMS to get bigger you can simple fork the repo.  
Here is also a link to discord(I know Slack is better for stuff like that   
but I would have to invite everybody single handed) [Invitelink](https://discord.gg/uDnah67)
